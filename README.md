# Data Science Projects

## tv_halftimeshows_thebiggame

This project uses a combination of data manipulation and visualization to explore television data.
This project will look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows.

## android_app_market_on_google_play

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. This project will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. This project will find insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty in scraping the latter as compared to the former. The data files are as follows:

- apps.csv : contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
- user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine and tagged with its sentiment score.

## github_history_of_the_scala_language

Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. This project will read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. This project will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

## visual_history_nobel_prize_winners

The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right?

Well, let's find out! What characteristics do the prize winners have? Which country gets it most often? And has anybody gotten it twice?

## dr_semmelweis_and_the_discovery_of_handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
